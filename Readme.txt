
Q3 TODO ("simpele" methode:
- Geneer alle mogelijke tuples van 3 vectors, gebruik makend van de vector IDs (dus <GHAE, G7F3, KAW1> bijvoorbeeld als 1 tuple)
- Bereken voor elke tuple aan vectors de aggregate vector
- Bereken voor elke tuple aan vectors de aggregate variance
- Beslis welke tuples de threshold tau halen

This is a template project for team project of 2AMD15 2023.

Various comments in the main.py file indicate where functionality needs to be implemented.
These comments are marked TODO.

You are allowed to change the layout of the main.py file (such as method names and signatures) in any way you like,
and you can add new functionality (possibly in new .py files). Do make sure that there exists a file called "main.py"
which contains the 'main module statement' of the form "if __name__ == '__main__':".

You can ZIP the main.py file along with any other .py files using any common compression tool. The archive should
be called app.zip and can be uploaded as such to the server.

Good luck on the project!
